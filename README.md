Hi! I'm Elijah (he/they), I'm a third year Computer Science undergrad with a double minor in Theatre Design and Media Arts.

My interests include generative and installation art, themed entertainment, immersive experiences, lighting and projection design, innovative storytelling, and algorithms and culture.

Outside of these things, I love theme parks, podcasts, and strategy games.
