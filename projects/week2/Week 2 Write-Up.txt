For this project, I decided to use bezier curves since I haven’t used the curve functions very much in Processing. I decided to make an interface where I could easily create them by clicking to add points to learn how they work more intuitively. Once I set up a framework where I could make curves with the mouse, I incorporated repetition. I split my program into two modes, a drawing mode and a viewing mode. In the drawing mode I could build/edit the curve, and in the viewing mode I could see the curve repeated in various ways. This would also show sliders where I could change the parameters live. In the viewing mode, I started with repetition combined with rotation. I exposed two parameters here, one for the number of duplicates drawn and another for the total angle. It was here that I realized the point which the curve is rotated around has a significant effect on the final design, so I added a feature where I could right click to set the rotation point. This led to some very interesting results, but now lines were frequently ending up off the page, so I added functionality to use the arrow keys to shift the placement of the curve around without having to entirely redraw it. Next I added repetition over a rectangular grid. This first involved adding a toggle to change between rotational and grid repetition in the viewing mode, then adding parameters for grid size, scale, and rotation.
