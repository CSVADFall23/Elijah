Because this week’s assignment involved hardware, I decided it would be a good time to utilize my 16x16 RGB LED grid since it can be controlled through an Arduino. I tried many different sensors- my first idea was to use two light/distance sensors so someone could define x-y coordinates by waving their hands, but I didn’t like this as with two hands in the air, it wouldn’t leave much else to control with. I then tried out a small joystick to control the x-y coordinate in conjunction with a slider and a couple buttons. After struggling with getting the slider set up and not liking how awkward the whole thing was to use, I scraped that. I eventually deciding on using a repurposed Wii Nunchuk, which has a joystick, two buttons, and three dimensional accelerometers. Once the wiring was complete to connect the arduino, LED matrix, wii nunchuk, and external powersource, I calibrated the controller so I had proper input values to work with. Now all that was left was to get the LED board to behave. This proved more challenging than expected. I started by moving around a single dot of light with the joystick, which went well. Then I tried to store RGB data for each pixel in the code, which is where I ran into some problems I hadn’t seen before. I ran out of memory on the arduino, then when I optimized the array it wouldn’t seem to take values into the pixels. Ultimately I decided to pivot with my remaining time and see what I could do without storing colors in memory. I set hue control to the x rotation, saturation control to the Y, and drawing on/off to one of the buttons (once the drawing button is released, the LEDs clear). I am disappointed I couldn’t get saving pixel values to work for this assignment, I love working with LEDs and would like to integrate them into future assignments, so I will continue working to find a solution.
