For this assignment, I started by experimenting with the stable diffusion web interface. I was interested in what happened when I gave it abstract pattern-based prompts, as I’d guess a generic training set would be more focused on achieving photorealisticity than clean geometry. I saved a number of these images, then decided to take three of them and recreate them in Processing. For the first piece, the prompt was “geometric points”, for the second and third it was “lines geometric complex colors”. Once the images were recreated in Processing, I generated variations by changing parameters. One thing that became very clear is that the geometric patterns generated by ai were very organic and irregular, featuring lots of shaky lines and gradients, which proved a challenge in Processing.
