The goal of the library was to create a series of functions which, when applied, can create a wide variety of image glitch art without having to touch the pixel array. I create a lot of this type of artwork myself, and I notice that I am often writing code for very similar functions over and over again. My hope is that the functions in this library can serve as the building blocks to produce a wide variety of results. One thing I did to make the library easier to use was provide multiple definitions of functions with different amounts of arguments. For example, with comparePixels(), all someone has to do to get started is provide a value, however if they want to get more precise, they can optionally supply a direction, threshold, and override. I also think the usage of enums makes it easy to see what is being passed into functions as arguments. I tried to make my function and enum names as literal as possible to make their purpose clear. For example, shiftBits() is literally bit shifting the pixel array.
