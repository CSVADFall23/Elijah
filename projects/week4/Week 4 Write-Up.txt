After deciding I wanted to create a color picker that uses images, I began playing around with how to get color from the images. I noticed that there are a lot of colors hiding in images that don’t appear very much but contrast nicely with the more frequently appearing colors- for example, in one of my testing images of a forest there is vibrant purple hiding in the slivers of sky in the background. These colors would be ignored in a tool that takes only the most frequently occurring colors from an image. The main feature of my color picker is that the user left clicks and holds, causing colors in the area near the mouse to appear in solid dots. Because the colors are selected randomly and then made bigger, it can reveal colors that an observer may not notice by simply looking at the image. The solid color bubbles draw out specific colors, but the user can continue clicking, holding, and moving their mouse around to see what colors continue to appear. When the user spots a color they are interested in, they right click ito add to the palette. Colors can be reordered in the palette by left clicking and dragging as well as deleted from the palette by right clicking. I like the balance between random generation of which colors have attention drawn to them versus manually choosing and reordering the palette. It is easy to use as the only controls are the mouse, but I am curious to see how intuitive the use of right and left clicks will be to a user without instructions.
